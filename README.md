## The problem Construction Crew-Rentals solves : 

1. Our platform is designed to solve the common challenges that customers face when looking for help with their projects. We reduce the communication gap between contractors, workers (labourers), and rental shop owners so that they can connect with their targeted audience – the customers. This saves our customers time and effort in finding the perfect worker, contractor, or product for their project.

2. Not only that, but we also strive to reduce unemployment by providing job opportunities to workers quickly by spreading their profiles in their local areas also provide option to customer to hire labours in group.

3. we make it easy for customers to find all the products they need in one place. This eliminates the need to search for different rental shops and compare prices, which can be time-consuming and frustrating. Our platform offers a wide range of products, including construction equipment like JCBs, trucks, rollers, and more, as well as smaller tools like screwdrivers and related items.

4. we provide flexibility to customers by offering rental options both on a single product basis and also as a group. This means that customers can rent a single product that they require, or they can rent a group of products related to their project, which can help to save them money and time.

5. We have an artificial intelligence chatbot, powered by OpenAI API, that has been customized to provide construction-related advice. This feature is particularly helpful for beginners who may not know how many workers, bricks, or cement bags are required for their project. By simply putting in the dimensions of the project, like the area and size (3bhk, 4bhk, etc.), they can get accurate recommendations.

6. Our platform ensures that all the products available for rent are of high quality and well-maintained. This gives customers peace of mind, knowing that the products they rent will perform effectively and efficiently, thus reducing the risk of project delays or disruptions

## Challenges We ran into: 

Our project crew rental store aims to provide a convenient and affordable solution for customers who need help with their projects. However, we also faced some challenges in developing our platform. Here are some of the challenges we encountered and how we overcame them:

### Challenge 1: How to reach and register laborers on our site?

Solution: To address this challenge, we sent bulk messages to laborers in specific areas or localities, inviting them to register on our platform. We also made it easier for them by providing the option to register at nearby cyber cafes.

### Challenge 2: How to verify their identity?

Solution: To ensure that all registered laborers are genuine, we require them to provide their Aadhar card as proof of identity during the registration process.

### Challenge 3: How to maintain product quality on our store?

Solution: We maintain product quality by regularly inspecting the products available for rent. We also ensure that all products are well-maintained and in good condition before renting them out to customers.

### Challenge 4: AI tool accuracy is low !

Solution: We addressed this challenge by inputting thousands of use cases related to construction into our AI chatbot. This helped to improve the accuracy of our AI tool, allowing it to provide more accurate recommendations and advice to customers.

Overall, we strive to provide the best possible experience for our customers by overcoming these challenges and continuously improving our platform. With our convenient services, affordable prices, and commitment to quality, we are confident that we can help you make your project a success.
